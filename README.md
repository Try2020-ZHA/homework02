# homework02

- P: I plan to finish the homework in one hour
- D: In fact, It took me almost two hours to finish my homework
- C: I use JavaScript well, but when I use the context map to decompose the task, the decomposition is not clear enough, which leads to confusion about the calling sequence after all functions are implemented, and it takes me a lot of time to find bugs
- I think I need to add exercises to the context map and be familiar with the task decomposition process to enhance the decoupling and readability of the code for subsequent maintenance and corrections

#### The context map

ps:这个上下文图与我的代码具体实现有些误差，不过整体还是没有什么问题的。。。
